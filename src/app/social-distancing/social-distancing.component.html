        <span class="no-vaccine">
          Social distancing is a non-pharmaceutical infection prevention and
          control intervention implemented to avoid/decrease contact between
          those who are infected with a disease causing pathogen and those who
          are not, so as to stop or slow down the rate and extent of disease
          transmission in a community. This eventually leads to decrease in
          spread, morbidity and mortality due to the disease.

            When going out in public, it is important to stay at least 6 feet
            away from other people and wear a cloth face covering to slow the
            spread of COVID-19. Consider the following tips for practicing
            social distancing when you decide to go out.When going out in

          <ul class="list-ticked">
            <li>
              Know Before You Go: Before going out, know and follow the guidance
              from local public health authorities where you live.
            </li>
            <li>
              Prepare for Transportation: Consider social distancing options to
              travel safely when running errands or commuting to and from work,
              whether walking, bicycling, wheelchair rolling, or using public
              transit, rideshares, or taxis. When using public transit, try to
              keep at least 6 feet from other passengers or transit operators.
            </li>
            <li>
              Limit Contact When Running Errands: Only visit stores selling
              household essentials in person when you absolutely need to, and
              stay at least 6 feet away from others who are not from your
              household while shopping and in lines. If possible, use
              drive-thru, curbside pick-up, or delivery services to limit
              face-to-face contact with others.
            </li>
            <li>
              Choose Safe Social Activities:It is possible to stay socially
              connected with friends and family who donâ€™t live in your home by
              calling, using video chat, or staying connected through social
              media.
            </li>
            <li>
              Stay Distanced While Being Active: If you decide to visit a nearby
              park, trail, or recreational facility, first check for closures or
              restrictions. If open, consider how many other people might be
              there and choose a location where it will be possible to keep at
              least 6 feet of space between yourself and other people who are
              not from your household.
