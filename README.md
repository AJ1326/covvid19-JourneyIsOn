# covid19

Covid has impacted us in many ways. Whether it's economy, job, anxiety, staying away, lost their loved ones, some are ill. We all are having a hard time, in one way or another. But there is always a positive aspect to every negative situation out there. Such times demand better you.
Doctors, nurses, delivery guys, and every frontline worker today is doing what is required. And being a developer, informing and making people aware is the least that I can do.
#ConfinedButNotBroken

My mission is to make people aware of the current situation and its aftermath. So, we all can take effective measures for the global pandemic that we are facing today and help the one in need. I tried to bring all the information together that made me fight through this time. We all are in this together.

# Getting started

1. Go to project folder and install dependencies:

```sh
npm install
```

2. Launch development server, and open `localhost:4200` in your browser:

```sh
npm start
```

# Main tasks

Task automation is based on [NPM scripts](https://docs.npmjs.com/misc/scripts).

| Task                                            | Description                                                                                                      |

When building the application, you can specify the target configuration using the additional flag
`--configuration <name>` (do not forget to prepend `--` to pass arguments to npm scripts).

The default build configuration is `prod`.

## Development server

Run `npm start` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change
any of the source files.
You should not use `ng serve` directly, as it does not use the backend proxy configuration by default.

## Code formatting

All `.ts`, `.js` & `.scss` files in this project are formatted automatically using [Prettier](https://prettier.io),
and enforced via the `test:ci` script.

A pre-commit git hook has been configured on this project to automatically format staged files, using
(pretty-quick)[https://github.com/azz/pretty-quick], so you don't have to care for it.

You can also force code formatting by running the command `npm run prettier`.

#### Tools
